The hotel is well-placed, room service was adequate and the restaurant’s menu is quite diverse.
The restaurant pricing was overly expensive.

Modern building, the rooms are adequate at the hotel level. Nice structure and services.
We booked a room for a week and paid in advance, as requested. However, we arrived at 3pm (check-in time at 2pm) but they gave us the room only after 9pm!! Unacceptable for any hotel.

We loved the view. The food that we had was very good but the restaurant prices were quite high. We enjoyed the pool area and found it very relaxing. We liked the bar that was open within the hotel. Reception were very helpful and informative.
Nothing.

The hotel is in a great location... about 20 minutes from the city with the metro station just around the corner so easy access to the city. The pool is a big advantage after a day shopping when you want to come back and relax.
One of the faults would be the price of some things. The cold breakfast was good but the hot one was very poor.

Perfect, professional service. Everything was done or delivered with a smile, quickly and efficiently. The hotel is quiet, beautifully decorated, fabulous pool and garden, also very near bus, train and tram stop into the city.
I did not like the fact that they closed the swimming pool so early in the evening.

Good views, good pool and gardens.
Our room was not clean and the staff blamed us. The staff could not speak very good English so I wasn’t able to complain.

The facilities are excellent and so were the service and the personnel. 
Location: it is quite isolated and far from the key places of the city. Parking: too expensive.
