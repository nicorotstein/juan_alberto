Clean warm comfortable. Friendly and efficient staff. Great shower and really comfortable bed.
The outside needs tidying up, looks a wee bit scruffy. Change the net curtains they look grubby

Large room, friendly staff
Noisy

We were flying early next morning so the location and standard for the one night was excellent. Also the fact that we could leave our car for the two weeks was so handy. Good value for money.
Could do with a bit of a facelift in places.

The spa - large room also
They allocate rooms on arrival - so as we arrived late we had the last room available which wasn't what we wanted ( we ordered twin, we got double) The other room available was on the smoking floor and very smelly

Parking, no hassle, clean comfy warm room, room only deal, convenient location.
Uninviting exterior

Size of room was excellent especially considering the price.
It said there would be room service 24/7 but I phoned up and was told there was no service for the rest of the night.

The food was good but the service was slow
Smell of cigarette smoke. The entrance to the car park had a lump of concrete which was difficult to drive over with my van. The window in my room had dust in the runners.

Cheap hotel near the airport with clean rooms
staff were very poor. very limited english and didn't smile or show any level of customer service. Didn't make you feel welcome or demonstrate any knowledge of the surrounding area.
