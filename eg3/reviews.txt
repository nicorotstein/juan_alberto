Location great for nightlife
rooms small breakfast minimal

I liked situation of hotel, friendly staff.
Quite dark and cold single room, everyday the same breakfast without any vegetables. But for this money I could not expect probably more.

I liked How much value I got for my money.
I didn't like that it wasn't sound isolated - I could hear everything in the room!

Relaxing, excelent lobby, great location, calm
I was affraid that my bed was going to crash during the night, the cleanliness of the room was very bad, the towels were horrible.

Breakfast included
Very noisy

The staff
The bedclothes (or sheets) are too short and hardly covered the mattress.

Nice rooms with cable tv and great location because it's very near to paceville' bars and to bus stops. Also the staffs are very kind. It's a good choice for solo travelers who just need a bed to sleep.
Bathroom floor was dirty, espacially the shower floor.

It was local to the restaurants, bars and clubs and was basic but value for money.
Difficult to find ! Has no signs outside to identify it until your find reception inside. Shower was poorly fitted and and flooded the bathroom whenever it was used.

The staff was very friendly and had helped with each problem, the breakfast was quite good and the hotel is well located.
Useing the internet was too expensive, house keeping was not good and it was too warm inside the room.
