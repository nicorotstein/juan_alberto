Very good location in the center, close to pubs and entertainment, swimming pool in order.
1. Hopeless breakfast, tasteless, 2. design and room furnishings inadequate shown in pictures, the rooms are the same regardless of whether they are two or four beds, 3. we bought a room with breakfast, the first day we were refused the breakfast because the staff could not check and confirm my booking, (paid us back money). 4. Noisy surroundings, although we did not mind. Near hotel very small beach.

The room was huge and the location is perfect!
It is not very nice, but for the price it really deserves.

The position, into the city center of St. George.
The people at the reception, absolutely not prepared to Client's Satisfaction or Customers care. No wlan connection in the rooms; in the lobby as to be paid. No clean in the room, no housekeeping in the room or to the beds.

Good price for a nice clean room.
The whistling noise that came from the balcony patio doors.

the hotel gave perfect value for the price, service was fine, location was great and had no problems with it. if all u r looking for is a place to sleep, that is where u should go.
the room was not well aired before we entred so had a funky smell at first.

Generally good value but see negatives below.
Breakfast was the worst I have ever had. The Black Bull nearby is much better value.The Shower was a bit of rubber pipe stuck into a hole in the tap unit. With nowhere to hang the shower head it has to be held in your hand, and then the pipe keeps coming out of the hole.

Good location if you want to party... Otherwise not family friendly as there are drunk people singing/screaming/being idiots all night long...
Staff are not friendly... Budget accom, have to pay 60euro up front (cash only) and dont get it back until you leave (deposit) Very noisy, breakfast not fantastic but ok if you are on a budget.
